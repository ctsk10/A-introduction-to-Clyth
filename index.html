  <p> I was born in Singapore and moved to Hong Kong when I was 3 years old. I'm now 10 and currently studying at Kennedy School. My hobbies include fixing 3-D models, caring for my pet hamster and playing video games. I am an avid reader and a young budding writer. My first novel will be published in the second half of 2020.</p>

                Aside from my intrest in environmental issues and social inequality, I am currently learning to code using HTML and CSS!
